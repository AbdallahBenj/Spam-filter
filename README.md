# Spam Filter with Regular Expressions - Certification Project

## Overview
This project is part of the certification requirements. In this project, I built a simple spam filter using JavaScript and Regular Expressions (Regex). The goal is to explore the power of regex in detecting patterns within text, and to build a basic tool that flags potential spam messages.
